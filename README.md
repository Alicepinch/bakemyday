## Design 

### Typography 

The fonts chosen for this website are Bebas Neue and Montserrat the reason for this choice was because they were clean, modern and complimented each other. 

### Colour Scheme 

The main colour's chosen for the website are pink and brown. For links and the hover colour for the Navigation bar I chose a brown colour to match the logo and a lighter brown for the hover as a lighter contrast. For links and buttons throughout the same pink colour with brown writing and on the pink background on the home I have used the reverse colourway.

## Data Modelling 

Heroku PostgreSQL has been used to host the backend database in production. The database used during development of the app is SQLite.

Below are all the models used for this project. This different models within this project map to a table in the projectâ€™s database, with each of its attributes corresponding to a specific column in that table.

The data schema was planned using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home).

![](docs/readme/wireframes/bake-my-day-data-modelling.jpg) - Need to update

## Key Models

### UserProfile

- The UserProfile model is connected to the User model that is created by Allauth when a user registers
- The default fields are fields that will populate is a user has saved information, this speeds up the checkout process by pre-populating shipping details when a user order's again.

### Order

- The Order model is connected to the UserProfile model, allowing the user to view all their previous orders.
- The Order model acts as a container for the order items. Although the item is stored within the OrderItem model, having them connected allows retrieving the item purchased.

### Blog Post

- The BlogPost model is conntected to the User model from allauth to generate the author of blogpost. 
- The BlogPost model holds all information for the blogpost.

### Blog Comment
- The BlogComment model is connected to the BlogPost model to link comments to the relevant blogpost that a user is commenting on
- The BlogComment is also connected to the User model from allauth to generate the author of the comment.
- When the blogpost is deleted, the comments connected to it will also delete in the database.

### Product

- The Product model holds all information for each product on the website.
- The Product model is connected to the Category model and Occasion Models which allows a user to filter products by category and occasion in navigation.

## Deployment

### Creating a local repository:

In order to run this on your local IDE you need to insure you have the following installed on your machine:

- PIP
- Python
- Git
- You will also need an account on MongoDB 

In order to deploy your own version of this website you will need to clone a local copy of the repository. To do this you need to follow the following steps.

- Click on the 'Code' button next to 'Add a file' when you have opened a repository
- To clone your repository by https:// click on the clipboard icon next to the URL.
- Once you have done this, open the terminal of your own IDE
  - The current directory will need to be changed to where you want your cloned directory.
- Type ```git clone https://github.com/Alicepinch/bakemydaybyamber.git``` into your terminal.

(There are other ways that you can clone a repository and these can be found on the [GitHub docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories))

Once the repository is cloned you will need to ensure that all the packages needed to run this app are installed. To install all packages from requirements.txt file using the following command in terminal.
``` pip3 -r requirements.txt ```

In your local IDE create a file called env.py.
Inside the env.py file create the following environment variables: 

``` 
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "{YOUR SECRET KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "{YOUR STRIPE SECRET KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "{YOUR WH SECRET KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_PUBLIC_KEY", "{YOUR PUBLIC KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")

```

**As some of this information is sensitive, be sure to create a ".gitignore" file and add "env.py"**

### Heroku deployment:

This repository can now be deployed to Heroku:

To deploy this project to Heroku you will need a Heroku acccount.
Once you have an account please follow the below steps. 

Before you deploy to heroku make sure you have dj_database_url and psycopg2 installed. To do this then enter the below into your terminal :

```
pip3 install dj_database_url
pip3 install psycopg2

```

1. In Heroku create a new app and set the region to EU. 
2. Next you want to Login to the Heroku CLI ```heroku login -i``` 
3. Run migrations on Heroku Postgres - ```heroku run python manage.py migrate```
3. Then Create a superuser - ```python manage.py createsuperuser``` 
4. Install gunicorn ```pip3 install gunicorn```
5. In your github project create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command ```pip3 freeze â€”-local > requirements.txt ``` (This is so Heroku can read all of the web apps that have been used in the project)

6. Create a Procfile by typing ```echo web: python app.py > Procfile``` into the terminal.

7. You will need to disable Heroku from collecting static files in your terminal with ```heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <your-app-name>```

8. Then add all files to github by typing 'git add .' into the terminal to stage all of your files. Then ```git commit -m "<message here>``` to commit the changes ready to be pushed to GitHub.

9. When all your files are ready to be pushed to github, type ```git push``` in the terminal.

10. Back on your Heroku dashboard for your application, go to 'Deploy'.

11. Within this section, scroll down to 'Deployment method' and select 'Connect to GitHub'

12. In the 'Connect to GitHub' section below - search for the github repository name. When you see the repository name click on the 'Connect' button.

13. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

14. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

15. In the fields fill out the following:

| Key | Value |
 --- | ---
DEBUG | FALSE
IP | 0.0.0.0
