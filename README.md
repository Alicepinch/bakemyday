In order to deploy your own version of this website you will need to clone a local copy of the repository. To do this you need to follow the following steps.

- Click on the 'Code' button next to 'Add a file' when you have opened a repository
- To clone your repository by https:// click on the clipboard icon next to the URL.
- Once you have done this, open the terminal of your own IDE
  - The current directory will need to be changed to where you want your cloned directory.

(There are other ways that you can clone a repository and these can be found on the [GitHub docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories))

Once the repository is cloned you will need to ensure that all the packages needed to run this app are installed. To install all packages from requirements.txt file using the following command in terminal.
``` pip3 -r requirements.txt ```

In your local IDE create a file called env.py.
Inside the env.py file create the following environment variables: 

``` 
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "{YOUR SECRET KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "{YOUR STRIPE SECRET KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "{YOUR WH SECRET KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_PUBLIC_KEY", "{YOUR PUBLIC KEY}")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")

```
